### SPA PRACTICE DAY - TASK

=> Creating a React website for a “Book Store”

The purpose of this task
- understand how useContext can solve the problem of global state in React applications
- deepen the technical skills of implementing useContext in a React application

What the “customer” wants for Christmas :christmas_tree::
- You will create a website that allows a user to
   - to enter his name on a page
   - select items to purchase on a second page
   - to be able to view and edit the items in the shopping cart on a third page
- The data is managed centrally by useContext.

- You can fetch the books from this address:
   - https://edwardtanguay.vercel.app/share/techBooks.json
- Note that the images here are based on the idCode of the book, e.g. for "bashCookbook"
   - https://edwardtanguay.vercel.app/share/images/techBooks/bashCookbook.jpg

Rule for the task:
- uses the hooks learned so far as needed (useContext MUST be used)

  :bangbang: :bangbang: :bangbang: => This is what your [PAGE](https://spa-pd-bookstore.vercel.app/) should look like afterwards <= :bangbang: :bangbang: :bangbang:

BONUS CHALLENGES:
- Make the name entry process more professional and improve user experience
- Display of the waiting time when the page loads slowly (waiting spinners)
- Give the user the ability to not only add books to cart but also remove books from cart
- For books of which more than one copy is ordered, display them together in the shopping cart, e.g. "2x titles"
- When you reload the page, the shopping cart should still be there with the previously selected books.
- Instead of a "Dark Mode", add a "Christmas Mode" :santa::christmas_tree::mrs_claus::christmas_tree::mx_claus:

===============================================================

You can either implement the project alone or code in pair programming (2 people)/mob programming (>2 people):
--> What is Pair Programming/ Mob Programming??? :desktop_computer:
- A developer (driver/pilot) takes control, writes the code and shares his screen via Zoom :clap:
- The remaining developers (navigators) simultaneously check the correctness of the code and develop possible solutions :eyes:
- There is almost no division of tasks as all developers have equal rights :busts_in_silhouette:
- The roles are changed continuously :arrows_counterclockwise:
- :handshake: So everyone looks at the same code and participates equally in the conversation via Zoom. :speech_balloon:
