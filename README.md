SPA EXERCISE DAY - TASK

=> Creating a React website for a “Book Store”

The purpose of this task
to understand how useContext can solve the problem of global state in React applications
Deepen the technical skills of implementing useContext in a React application

What the “customer” wants (for Christmas :christmas_tree:):
You will create a website that allows a user to
to enter his name on a page
select items to purchase on a second page
To be able to view and edit the items in the shopping cart on a third page
The data is managed centrally by useContext.

You can access the books from this address:
https://edwardtanguay.vercel.app/share/techBooks.json
Note that the images here are based on the idCode of the book, e.g. for "bashCookbook"
https://edwardtanguay.vercel.app/share/images/techBooks/bashCookbook.jpg

Rule for the task:
uses the hooks learned so far as needed (useContext MUST be used)

   :bangbang: :bangbang: :bangbang: => This is what your PAGE should look like afterwards <= :bangbang: :bangbang: :bangbang:

BONUS CHALLENGES:
Make the name entry process professional and improve user-friendliness
Display of the waiting time when the page loads slowly (waiting spinners)
Giving the user the ability to not only add books to the cart but also remove books from the cart
For books of which more than one copy is ordered, display them together in the shopping cart, e.g. “2x titles”
When the page is reloaded, the shopping cart should still be there with the previously selected books.
Instead of a “Dark Mode”, build a “Christmas Mode” :santa::christmas_tree::mrs_claus::christmas_tree::mx_claus:

===========================================================

You can either implement the project alone or code in pair programming (2 people)/mob programming (>2 people):
--> What is Pair Programming/ Mob Programming???:desktop_computer:
A developer (driver/pilot) takes control, writes the code and shares his screen via Zoom :clap:
The remaining developers (navigators) simultaneously check the correctness of the code and develop possible solutions :eyes:
There is almost no division of tasks as all developers have equal rights :busts_in_silhouette:
The roles are continually swapped :arrows_countercentury:
:handshake: Everyone also looks at the same code and participates equally in the conversation via Zoom. :speech_balloon:
